Given an array arr[] and an integer diff, count the number of ways to partition the array into two subsets such that the difference between their sums is equal to diff.
Note: A partition in the array means dividing an array into two subsets say S1 and S2 such that the union of S1 and S2 is equal to the original array and each element is present in only one of the subsets.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [5, 2, 6, 4], diff = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one possible partition of this array. Partition : [6, 4], [5, 2]. The subset difference between subset sum is: (6 + 4) - (5 + 2) = 3.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], diff = 0 
Output: 6 
Explanation: We can choose two 1's from indices [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3] and put them in sum1 and remaning two 1's in sum2.
Thus there are total 6 ways for partition the array arr. 

Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 7, 1], diff = 4  
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no possible partition of the array that satisfy the given difference. 

Constraint:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 50
0 ≤ diff ≤ 50
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 6

Approach:
Using Space Optimized DP – O(N × totalSum) Time and O(totalSum) Space
The idea is to optimize space by observing that only the previous state of the DP table is required to count subsets with sum equal to (diff+totalSum)/2.
Instead of using a full 2D DP array, we use a 1D array and update it in reverse order to avoid overwriting necessary values.
For each element, we decide whether to include it in the subset and update the number of ways to form different sums accordingly.
After processing all elements, the value at the target index gives the number of ways to achieve the required sum, which represents the number of valid partitions with the given difference.

Solution:
  class Solution {
    public int countPartitions(int[] arr, int diff) {
        // code here
        int sum = Arrays.stream(arr).sum();

        // validate conversion to target
        if ((sum + diff) % 2 != 0 || sum < diff)
            return 0;

        int target = (sum + diff) / 2;
        int n = arr.length;

        // dp[j] = ways to form sum j
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];

        // one way to make sum 0
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            // update from right to avoid reuse of same element
            for (int j = target; j >= arr[i]; j--) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - arr[i]];
            }
        }

        return dp[target];
    }
}
