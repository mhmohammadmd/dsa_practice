You are given the root of a BST and an integer key. You need to find the inorder predecessor and successor of the given key. If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.
Note: In an inorder traversal the number just smaller than the target is the predecessor and the number just greater than the target is the successor. 

Examples :
Input: root = [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80], key = 65
Output: [60, 70]
Explanation: In the given BST the inorder predecessor of 65 is 60 and inorder successor of 65 is 70.

Input: root = [8, 1, 9, N, 4, N, 10, 3], key = 8
Output: [4, 9]
Explanation: In the given BST the inorder predecessor of 8 is 4 and inorder successor of 8 is 9.

Constraints: 
1 ≤ no. of nodes ≤ 105
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 106
1 ≤ key ≤ 106
Approach:
Using Single Traversal - O(h) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to traverse the BST once to find both the predecessor and successor of a given key.
If node < key, it can be the predecessor, so move to the right subtree to find a larger value still < key.
If node > key, it can be the successor, so move to the left subtree to find a smaller value still > key.
If node = key, predecessor is the maximum in left subtree and successor is the minimum in right subtree.

Solution:
  /*
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;
    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
     static Node rightMost(Node node) {
        while (node.right != null) {
            node = node.right;
        }
        return node;
    }

    static Node leftMost(Node node) {
        while (node.left != null) {
            node = node.left;
        }
        return node;
    }
    public ArrayList<Node> findPreSuc(Node root, int key) {
        // code here
         // return ArrayList with predecessor at index 0 
    // and successor at index 1
    
        Node pre = null, suc = null;
        Node curr = root;

        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.data < key) {
                pre = curr;
                
                // look for predecessor with greater value
                curr = curr.right;
            } else if (curr.data > key) {
                suc = curr;
                
                // look for successor with smaller value
                curr = curr.left;
            } else {
                if (curr.left != null)
                    pre = rightMost(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null)
                    suc = leftMost(curr.right);
                break;
            }
        }

        ArrayList<Node> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(pre);
        result.add(suc);
        return result;
    }
}
